<h1><center><b>hi. this is my vent page.</h1></center></b>
<p><center>if i offend you with anything, please don't. this is all my opinion, so take it lightly. thank you for understanding :). also, if you read through this, you're probably epic.</p></center>
<h1><b>the modern world.</h1></b>
<p>we are all human. no matter what skin color, culture, height, personality, or any other descriptive factor you can identify yourself with. discriminative actions have taken place in the history of the world, including multiple enslavements of certain cultural backgrounds. in our now <b>modern</b> and thankfully smarter world, we have gotten rid of slavery in almost all countries. it pains me to hear that slavery is still a gigantic issue in countries like India, China, Pakistan, and a few others. discrimination and the enslavement of a people group that's more poverty-ridden than yours, or the exploitation of your own people group is never right. </p>
<p>even though i refer to our world as modern, there are still many factors that hold it back from being truly modern. financial troubles, starvation, slavery (as previously mentioned), and many more obstacles hold us back from being a perfect world. but, who said we can be perfect? humans always make mistakes. this is still not an excuse for massive grievances against humanity. for example, murdering someone in cold blood is <b>not</b> a mistake. it's fully intentional, and disgusting. the modern world sounds like such a true statement for people living in first world countries. they have cars, food on the plate, free clean water, a roof to live under, and a forseeable future. for others in less fortunate countries, all of those things are <b>not</b> freebies. they either work extremely hard to get those things, or don't have access to those things at all. i'm not telling you to instantly start donating to a charity, but keep those things in mind.</p>
<h1><p>emotions.</h1></p>
<p>what do you think about, when you think about the perfect man? think for a couple seconds. did you think about a super buff guy, with a chiseled chin and perfect hair and smile? did you think about a chivalrous man who does everything perfectly, and never shows emotion other than happiness and neutrality? if you did, that's what the world holds as the perfect man. and, if you did think of that, you're correct. that is the "mold" men try to fit into. that mold is a very lofty goal, but it is a respectable goal to attain and try to work for. but, if you couldn't tell, those men rarely exist in <b>the modern world</b> (see what i did there?).</p>

<p>see those statistics? they show that <b>less than 50%</b> of men who were known to have anxiety or depression took action on taking care of those feelings. men are always expected to be the head of the family. they are supposed to be the breadwinners. they are supposed to be the person who keeps the family safe and financially secure. men aren't supposed to be anxious. they aren't supposed to be depressed, or even cry. all of these cultural impositions have been traditional values that have lasted for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.</p>
<p>well, i say fuck those values. men should be able to talk about how they feel, even if they're anxious or depressed or whatever the fuck they're feeling. having thoughts about bodily harm should <b>never, ever, EVER </b> be disregarded. even if some men "act" like they're depressed, and threaten self-harm, it shouldn't be taken lightly. if you ever feel those thoughts, report them <b>immediately</b> to someone you trust, or to a suicide prevention lifeline.</p>
<h1>my thoughts on life.</h1>
<p>life, as it has been since the beginning of the world, is finite. everything dies. everyone you know, and will meet in your lifetime will pass away. this is an extremely hard topic to discuss, since even the thought of talking about death can make some unweary. but, life doesn't give a shit about you or your family. from dust we began, and to dust we will become. for those with a religious background, you may know that reference. having a religious outlook on life can make you have less worry about death, but it still lingers. death never goes away. it's always in the back of our minds, and it will only leave when we die. now, the hard hitting question about death is: </p>
<font size=5>
<p><i><b>"where will i go when i die?"</b></i></p>
<font size=3>
<p>there are hundreds of answers to this question. they come from all around the world, and vary greatly. from my point of view, there can only be one answer to this question. our human, mistake-making body will obviouslly decompose and rot. but, do we have a soul? is our inner consiousness real and spiritual, or is it just our bodies making that up? there are many more questions i have about the soul and the mind, but i have  almost no answers, except those i was taught in my religious upbringing.</p>
<p>anyways, life is simple. humans are born and taught. they work, reproduce, retire, and eventually die. this is, at least for many, the average life cycle of a human. life is short. it brings with it many experiences, that fill you with happiness, excitement, sadness, etcetera.</p>
<p>life is confusing. you're expected to follow the guidelines of society (omg anarchy1!!1!! omg hehee funny joker society meme). there are rulebreakers, but they're easily arrested and put into prison. it's essential to put those who don't follow the rules into some form of punishment. but, what about countries like North Korea? free thinkers and those who support other countries are instantly "dealt with," and put into prisons or punished. why do we allow places like this to exist? everyone has basic human necessities, and one of them <b>should be</b> free speech.</p>
<p>to put it into simpler words: life is short. enjoy it while you still have it.</p>
<h1>my demons.</h1>
<p>i guess i can talk about them here, since almost nobody will read this. everyone has demons, right? there's always that one thing in your head you worry about. maybe it's not being good enough. maybe it's passing that test next period. maybe it's that whole life section you just read through that made you think. it could be anything that makes you feel bad, worthless, or even suicidal. if you want to, you can read through a few of my inner demons.</p> 
<p>my social and general anxiety. it may not seem like i have any, but i have a lot of it. bad. some days, it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. i constantly run situations through my mind, thinking about how i could've done things better. i stay up at 3 am with thoughts in my brain about something someone said about or to me. i zone out in the middle of important things. i rip cuticles and skin off of my fingers. i know most of these things occur due to me just being a softy, but i have to deal with it all the time. i take insults just fine when they first appear, but they always haunt me. don't pity me for my anxiety, i function perfectly fine so it's no biggie.<p>
<p>my stuttering issue. if you've talked to me, you'll know sometimes i get lost mid-sentence, or i fuck up part of my point. that's normal for humans, but it does happen often with me. i don't really have any explanation for it, except for maybe my brain is faster than my mouth. making fun of it doesn't really affect me, so feel free to tease me for it. or not, that's up to you.</p>
<p>i don't know why, but i think i have adhd. it's not diagnosed though. with all the things i mentioned above, along with shaky hands and a tendency for talking when other people talk, it seems possible. but, since it's not medically official i don't say i have it.</p>
<p>i've always been self consious of my body. when i was a kid, i was never taught how to have a good diet. both my mom and my dad are not healthy eaters, and that caused me to do the same. i always got teased for being a little chubby, and that didn't bother me until around a year ago. i was 6'0", and pushing 200 pounds. i was a big boy. i knew that, because almost every person i met in school would tell me that. but, after years of being told that, i had enough. i started cutting breakfast entirely out of my day, and skipping meals almost every day as well. as a result of this, i got more lethargic and depressed. but, it worked. i'm currently 6'2" and i weigh around 170 pounds. i might have to start eating more for college, but that may not happen.</p>
<p>my skin. since i'm half carribean american, i have bumps <b>everywhere</b>. arms, back, chest. you name it, it's got bumps. this causes me to wear long-sleeved shirts or hoodies everywhere. causes a lot of my anxiety, but it's only skin-deep.<p>
<p>yeah, those are my demons. feel free to make fun of me for them LOL.</p>
